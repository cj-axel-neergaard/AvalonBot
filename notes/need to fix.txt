last quest counter freezes when I press "S" on the voting
it still updates it correctly after I press S or F on the last quest

maybe get rid of the score counter in bottom left, redundant

fill screen space with info about characters etc.

currently after Merlin is assassinated the game counts it as a third fail instead of the unique win condition
